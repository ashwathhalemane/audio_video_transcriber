All must be done as one. If one fails, all fail. When the keymaker says, all must work as one, it sounds like the Upanishads, and I hear overtones of Advaita Vedanta. The Upanishads were scriptures, essentially, that were written about 800 B.C. They are texts which discuss philosophy at a deep level. They're probably the earliest serious philosophical texts. In them is a teaching of monism. Sometimes it's called Advaita Vedanta. And this is the belief that all things are united as one. All things come from the same source, Brahman, who is the foundation of all being. And so the goal of this form of Hinduism is to realize your identity with the all. A program can either choose to hide here or return to the source. The machine mainframe. Yes. Where you must go. Where the path of the one ends. You can see Reloaded.
